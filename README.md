# My continuous dedication to learn algorithms on **LeetCode**

`LeetCode record.docx` records my notes while solving LeetCode problems.

Files within `./Code/` folder represents my accepted solutions, through not all program have my handwritten test cases in the main method

Files within `./NonOptimal/` folder represents potentially correct solutions, through they do not satisfy time and/or memory constraint

Files within `./PartiallyCorrect/` folder represents potentially correct solutions that do not pass all test cases

Files within `./PrevAttempt/` folder represents my previous incorrect approaches before reaching to a correct solution in the `./Code/` folder
    Note: my attempts that I believe correct but exceeds time and/or memory limit is in `./NonOptimal/` folder

Programming files are named as following: `Q<question_number><difficulty>.<coding_language>` , such as `Q21E.java` or `Q143M.java`
